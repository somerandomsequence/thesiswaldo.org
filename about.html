Thesis Waldo is the absurd creation of overworked Ph.D. candidates at the University of Colorado, 
who were interested to know how many people might actually read their theses. Insofar as self-reporting is accurate,
Thesis Waldo also seeks to answer how often theses are read in general, and by whom. 
If you would like to use Thesis Waldo in your thesis, simply include Waldo somewhere,
add a link to thesiswaldo.org, and email your name and thesis title to register@thesiswaldo.org. We'll
send you annual statistics about how often your thesis is read, and in the case that the statistics
are a nullset, our sincere condolences and commiseration.
